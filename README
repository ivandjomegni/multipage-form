This is a single script that creates a multi-page, wizard type, input screens. 

The script must display at least 3 different pages. 

Page #1 should allow the user fill in at least two text fields as well as one check box. 
Page #2 should ask for 4 more fields to be entered. 
The last page should display a summary screen of all the data in the first two pages but should not allow any modifications. 

Add appropriate navigation buttons on the pages so the user can go back and correct any data as necessary.

Develop the above using hidden fields on the forms.
